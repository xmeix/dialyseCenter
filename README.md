# dialyseCenter

This is my first ever web application which i made in 2021, using html, sass, javascript for the front-end, and php, mysql for the backend.
In this work, we are interested in creating a graphical interface for the management of a dialysis center. 

The management of this facility includes the following modules:
- Patient management:
  which involves saving the data of each patient and updating it with each dialysis operation.
  This includes the history of prescribed treatments with the dates of the conducted analyses
  and the prescribed dietary regimens for each patient.

- Medical staff management at the center:
  which involves managing doctors and nurses, updating their information, and the ability to add,
  remove, or modify them.

- Supplies management:
  which allows for the addition or removal of supplies.

- Financial management:
  which includes managing the payroll for the staff and handling patient invoices, taking into
  account cases of additional medical care.
